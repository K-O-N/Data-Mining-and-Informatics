# Data Mining and Informatics: Predicting Income with Multiple Classifiers

## Project Title: Data Mining and Informatics: Predicting Income with Multiple Classifiers
This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to predict income using the adult_WS#3 dataset. The primary objective is to evaluate the performance of various classifiers in predicting whether a person's income exceeds a specific threshold.

### Objectives:
Task: Implement and compare four classification algorithms:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree (DT)
Random Forest (RF)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Evaluation: Assess the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by cleaning, encoding, and normalizing features to ensure compatibility with the classifiers.
### Model Training: 
Train each classifier on the dataset and optimize hyperparameters where necessary.
Performance Evaluation: Use evaluation metrics and confusion matrices to compare classifier effectiveness.
### Insights and Conclusion: Summarize findings, including the most effective classifier for this dataset and potential improvements.
Features of the Project:
Comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline.
Implementation of four popular classification models.
Detailed evaluation using standard performance metrics.
Visualizations of model performance and results for better interpretability.

### Results:
Each classifier's performance is documented and visualized.
Recommendations for further work and potential model improvements are provided.
